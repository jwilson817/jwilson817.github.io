        <h2>  How to play: <br> You will start off as a square, get all food also known as green circles. The more green circles you eat the bigger you get.  <br> There will be a score of how many circles you collect, the higher the score the better.  </h2>

      
        
       
        <h3> Controls: <br> The square will follow your mouse <br> Go on top of the green circles to collect them <br>   </h3>

    <h4> Bug report: my game does not collect the circles. there is no score in my game. there also is no randomized spawns.</h4>
